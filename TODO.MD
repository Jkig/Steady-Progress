# TODO:
* edit old data
* data and smoothdata will probably be tougher, for now I'll get it to work and imporove preformance later, but for now max is 2 data points per day, I have time to get it out there and fix preformance later.
* I think the strategy is coding/decoding


# From the above things, the MVP is ready. Release ASAP and get users trying it
* Chat with some people about how to make the posting look good


# Bigger/later things
* ask users what they want!!
* do the projections for true weight and true start weight
* Store data in the cloud
* Sign in with google and apple
* longer projections, and showing a goal weight change line
* graphs of progress over time/ different periods (3 month, 6 month 1 year)
* personal data stuff, so can calculate BMI, estimate passive caloric burn, connect with apple info, etc.
