# Current todo (final big test data and then set up for read data):
* have nick, zo, ben, maybe one more check to see if it looks good, then decide on smoothing


* change Model to use correct date type (down to hour, maybe day)
* add measurement
* make sure to test this, and that switch to other calculation happens at the right time
* do not add if the most recent was within the same hour.(maybe day?)
* store User data on device


# next things/ easy things:
* if settings change, I need to refresh the main page. Ex toggle show Goal
* allow adjusting goal (will basically be an easier copy of adding values)
* finally deleting old data (follows from adding values)
* finish personal data stuff
* go through each value and make sure it is displayed correctly


# From the above things, the MVP is ready. Release ASAP and get users trying it
* and chat with some people about how to make the posting look good


# Bigger/later things
* do the projections for true weight and true start weight
* Data stored with Firebase probably
* Sign in with google and apple, leave it there for now
* longer projections, and showing a goal weight change line
* graphs of progress over time
* ask users what they want
