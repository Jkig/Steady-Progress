# Do the basics well:
* documentation
* improve about and readme
* get all the way to good MVVM

# Pull some of these parts out, it works, now make it maintainable and readable
* keyboard is going to be annoying but worth it to pull out
* bring my added stuff (Cancel, add and set) out
* pull testing out of mainView
* separate some of the mainView logic


# Bigger/later things
* ask users what they want!!
* allow users to set smoothing length, perhaps from a few presets?
* do the projections for true weight and true start weight
* Store data in the cloud
* Sign in with google and apple
* longer projections, and showing a goal weight change line
* graphs of progress over time/ different periods (3 month, 6 month 1 year)
* personal data stuff, so can calculate BMI, estimate passive caloric burn, connect with apple info, etc.
