# Do the basics well:
* get it to work for Mac, the problem is that its stretching the app to width of keyboard(maybe of iPad maybe of Mac) not exactly sure how to solve yet, could just detect the os and get rid of the keyboard, or build separately for Mac I guess.
* documentation
* improve about and readme
* I don't need iPhone to be upgraded to latest iOS version, maybe 15 is good enough?
* Pull some of these parts out, it works, now make it maintainable and readable


# Bigger/later things
* ask users what they want!!
* allow users to set smoothing length, perhaps from a few presets?
* do the projections for true weight and true start weight
* Store data in the cloud
* Sign in with google and apple
* longer projections, and showing a goal weight change line
* graphs of progress over time/ different periods (3 month, 6 month 1 year)
* personal data stuff, so can calculate BMI, estimate passive caloric burn, connect with apple info, etc.
