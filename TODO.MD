# Current todo (final big test data and then set up for read data):
* have nick, zo, ben, maybe one more check to see if it looks good, then decide on smoothing, ask about daily only??
* store User data on device
* Reload Chart when stuff that effects it changes (toggle smoothed data, toggle show Goal and what the goal is itself)


# From the above things, the MVP is ready. Release ASAP and get users trying it
* and chat with some people about how to make the posting look good


# Bigger/later things
* do the projections for true weight and true start weight
* fill in info between for missed datys or something, not sure how I want to do this yet.
* Actually I think Charts does this for me if i chart by Date, I love swiftUI!!!
* Data stored with Firebase probably
* Sign in with google and apple, leave it there for now
* longer projections, and showing a goal weight change line
* graphs of progress over time
* ask users what they want
* personal data stuff, so can calculate BMI, estimate passive caloric burn, connect with apple info, etc.
