# Current todo (final big test data and then set up for read data):
* have zo, ben, and liv see if it looks good, then decide on smoothing

# store data on device
* data and smoothdata will probably be tougher, for now I'll get it to work and fix preformance later
* I think the strategy is coding/decoding, 

* Reload Chart when stuff that effects it changes toggle smoothed data, toggle show Goal and what the goal is itself
* edit old data (I think reload fail is causing problem)
* Reload edit dataprobably edit old data too


# From the above things, the MVP is ready. Release ASAP and get users trying it
* and chat with some people about how to make the posting look good


# Bigger/later things
* ask users what they want!!
* do the projections for true weight and true start weight
* Store data in the cloud
* Sign in with google and apple
* longer projections, and showing a goal weight change line
* graphs of progress over time/ different periods (3 month, 6 month 1 year)
* personal data stuff, so can calculate BMI, estimate passive caloric burn, connect with apple info, etc.
