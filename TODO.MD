# Basic things to get to in time:
* Error handling for crazy numbers of change, or non numbers etc.
* make sure to stop
* consider toggling the ability to see raw measurements.
* build or find a type that allows me to store data to the hour, then use it only for date info
* each measurement will have a date, weight, and maybe UUID, or just allow one measurement per hour max and use it to delete data?


# Implicitly promised in current 
* KG/lbs setting? Or just have them imply, by putting in however they want, for bmi and stuff later it will be important though.
* goal line toggle EZ.
* Smooth measurements Toggle
* implement smoothing


# Bigger things
* accounts and data stored with Firebase probably
* probably sign in with google and apple, leave it there for now
