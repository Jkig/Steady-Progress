# What's the point?
* People likely work hard, see the scale, and based on a basically random fluctuation, become discouraged and quit their diet
* People often gain weight, but very slowly, if you gain 5 lbs over 6 months its hard to tell anything happened, as weight can fluctuate that much based on a few big meals.
* When I gained 10 lbs over 1.5 years, there was no point where "wow everything has changed", but this leads to a cycle where diets are necessary, maybe just light diets periodically, but still probably less healthy long run.

# Try it out!
* I'm going to by submitting to apple soon, there will be a link here when its available
